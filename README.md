# Counter
This project uses the FPGA board to show how one can count in decimal up to 15 using hexadecimal. It uses small 'd' to differentiate D from 0 on the FPGA. It uses 'b' to differentiate B from 8.
It introduces the basics of digital system design using a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A hardware description language (SystemVerilog), introduced in lectures, is used to configure the FPGA. 
The FPGA used is the Altera Cyclone V, which is a powerful System on Chip device that you can use in later projects.

Aims, Learning Outcomes and Outline
This laboratory exercise aims to:
• Introduce a person to programmable logic devices;
• Give experience of SystemVerilog;
• Give an opportunity to design and test a digital system using a Field-Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA).
Having successfully completed the project, you will be able to:
• understand the differences between a programmable logic device and a microprocessor;
• use professional software tools: Modelsim and Quartus to develop SystemVerilog code
for an FPGA design, simulate it, debug and synthesise into hardware;
• design a simple logic circuit, describe it in SystemVerilog, synthesise it with Quartus and
implement it on an FPGA.
This laboratory provides an opportunity to program and test a Field-Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) implementation of a state machine.
The exercise introduces you to the practicalities of digital system description in an HDL
(SystemVerilog), introduced in lectures, allowing you to become familiar with FPGA
programming, simulation and testing. The FPGA used is the Altera Cyclone V, a volatile,
programmable device. This has the advantage that design errors can be rapidly and cheaply
corrected.
The software tools installed in the Electronics Laboratory for FPGA designs are:
• Modelsim from Mentor Graphics – a digital system simulator,
• Quartus from Intel/Altera – an advanced digital synthesis tool,
Full information on the FPGA development board, including the FPGA Data Sheet, is included
on the Laboratory website at https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/ellabs/databook/pld, which also
includes a link for downloading a starter version of Quartus
