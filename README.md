# Counter
This project uses the FPGA board to show how one can count in decimal up to 15 using hexadecimal. It uses small 'd' to differentiate D from 0 on the FPGA. It uses 'b' to differentiate B from 8.
It introduces the basics of digital system design using a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A hardware description language (SystemVerilog), introduced in lectures, is used to configure the FPGA. 
The FPGA used is the Altera Cyclone V, which is a powerful System on Chip device that you can use in later projects.
